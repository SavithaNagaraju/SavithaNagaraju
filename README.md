# Instructions:

## clone

## package updates

There are many ways to update your Docusaurus version. One guaranteed way is to manually change the version number in package.json to the desired version. Note that all @docusaurus/-namespaced packages should be using the same version.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@docusaurus/core": "2.4.0",
    "@docusaurus/preset-classic": "2.4.0",
  }
}
```
Then, in the directory containing package.json, run your package manager's install command:

```bash
npm install
```

## build and deploy
Follow [article](https://github.com/LayZeeDK/github-pages-docusaurus)

```bash
cd SavithaNagaraju
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## run locally

```bash
cd SavithaNagaraju
npm run start
```
